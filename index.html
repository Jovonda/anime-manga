            <h2>Gist</h2>
            <p class= "p-index">This website will have Anime that will be in different genre.The main page of this website will have maybe a known icon on the front saying welcome.
            For each page a character genre will a genre, like Goku for shounen or Shinya Kogami for mystery.
            Each page will have about five to maybe ten Anime/Manga to recommend with a short summary of each and a fact about it.
            If possible I could maybe draw/get an image that will represent the feeling a person should have when looking at each page.
            If possible there might be away to say that a person might like an anime/manga and want to give it a like to make it more popular.
            For the first manga/anime at the top of the screen there should be a trailer to get the viewer hooked. For example, if Psycho Pass (Mystery), is popular (my opinon) it should have a video along with it at the top.
            Each page should be able to link back to other pages and each page should contain a way back to home.</p>
